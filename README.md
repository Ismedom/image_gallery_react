# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and includes some ESLint rules for linting your code.

Currently, two official plugins are available for integrating React with Vite:

-   **[@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md)**: This plugin uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) to enable Fast Refresh for React, ensuring a smooth development experience with instant updates to the page during code edits.
-   **[@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc)**: This plugin uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) as a faster alternative to Babel, also providing Fast Refresh for React.

To get started, simply choose one of the two plugins depending on your preference for Babel or SWC.
